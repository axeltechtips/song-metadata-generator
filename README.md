# song-metadata-gen
A Python Script that uses mutagen to add metadata to a song file.

This was tested on macOS with MP3 files and works fine.
# What is the purpose?
Because some songs / MP3s don't have metadata which could be frustrating at times.

This adds metadata to the song which makes it easier to 
1. Find music
2. Know what music you're listening too.
3. Make your music look nice.
# Things to work on
1. GUI
2. Other file formats.
