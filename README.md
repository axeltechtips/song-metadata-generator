# song-metadata-gen
A Python Script that uses mutagen to add metadata to a song file.

This was tested on macOS with MP3 files and works fine.
# Want to build it you're self?
No problem! Go into the latest release and download S-M-G.py

Once you are done install Python and do this

Windows
```python
py -m pip install mutagen pyqt5 pillow
```
If Python is in Windows $PATH just do
```python
pip install mutagen pyqt5 pillow
```
POSIX systems
```python
pip3 install mutagen pyqt5 pillow
```
# What is the purpose?
Because some songs / MP3s don't have metadata which could be frustrating at times.

This adds metadata to the song which makes it easier to 
1. Find music
2. Know what music you're listening too.
3. Make your music look nice.
# Things to work on
1. GUI (done)
2. Other file formats. (more image formats are done but song formats arent)
